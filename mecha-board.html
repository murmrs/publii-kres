Even though it was in the 2000’s, Walgreens utilized a POS system powered by IBM’s AS/400 (they may even still; it’s been a hot minute since I was there). The system in our store had a wonderfully obnoxious Model-M variant attached to it’s console.</p><p>While I had familiary with high-quality (for the time) gaming perpherals, I wasn’t super well versed with mechanical keyboards themselves. Time passed, and when my Razer products (another post for another time) all started giving out, I looked at the market and settled on a <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/VENGEANCE%C2%AE-K60-Performance-FPS-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/p/CH-9000004-NA">Corsair K60</a> as my first truly mechanical keyboard (though the function keys were still membrane).</p><p>It worked well, until it didn’t.</p><p>Keys started giving out, and I needed to look at different options.</p><p>While my Wife and I were dating, I explored other, smaller options, eventually settling on a Poker II with clear switches. That keyboard lasted a long time - staying with me, and finding it’s place as my ‘office’ keyboard of choice at my previous agency.</p><p>My brother still uses that keyboard - it’s built like a tank, and will probably outlast both of us.</p><p>After I left that agency, I decided I wanted a bit of a better setup at home. I ended up ordering the ErgoDox Infinity from Massdrop (now Drop) with Cherry Blue’s. I’m sure it annoys everone on the Zoom calls we all constantly find oursleves on these days - but I love it. It took some getting used to, but the value in a split keyboard to me is tremendous. It feels better. It works better. And I can program the ever livin’ heck out of it.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://kres.ch/1.jpg" alt="A surprise visit from your friendly neighborhood Tachikoma" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><blockquote><p>There are many keyboards like it, but this one is mine.</p></blockquote><p>But I don’t think it’ll be the ‘Endgame (trademark pending, or something)’. The HHKB has been on my list for more years than I care to admit, and while my wallet continunes to say no, my eyes are saying yes.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 18, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://kres.ch/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://kres.ch/authors/steven-kreschollek/" rel="author">Steven Kreschollek</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://kres.ch/on-loss-and-having.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> On Loss and Having</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://kres.ch/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://kres.ch/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
