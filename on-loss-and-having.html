It hurts, because I remember the man he was - I wasn’t a child - but mostly, I remember him through my dad. Through the stories he shares of driving through New York traffic with his dad, listening to him complain about the amount of toxins we were pumping in the air, even back then. A true conservative, for whatever worth that word has these days.</p><p>For my moms parents in New York - the story was much the same. I have memories of spending summers there, visting our cousins, and staying at their house. I’ll never forget the smell of dew in a basement, and it will always bring me back to that little white house in Aquebogue. But as the years drag on, so to, do the memories. We lost my Grandfather, my moms dad, the year after I started dating my wife.</p><p>But my Grandmothers - they continued on. Never forgetting their husbands and there lives. And while I remember, throughout the years, the wishes from my Nana that she be returned to her husband, I’m grateful for every moment both of them were with us for. My dads mom didn’t get to come to our wedding - but she got to live through it in pictures and shared laughter. My moms mother did - and danced the night away with her grandchildren.</p><p>But at the end of it all, none of them will truly ever be gone. Our grandparents, our friends, our families, they all live on. In the people they touched. In the kids they raised.</p><p>I wouldn’t be here without them.</p><p>So much of the love and guidance in my life has been from my parents, who by extension wouldn’t have been the people they are without the love of their own.</p><p>❤ and miss you, Nana, Papa, Grandma, and Grampa.</p><p>You raised some good ones.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 18, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.kres.ch/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.kres.ch/authors/steven-kreschollek/" rel="author">Steven Kreschollek</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.kres.ch/mecha-board.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Mecha-board</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://www.kres.ch/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://www.kres.ch/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
